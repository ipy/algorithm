## Support

- javascript
- typescript
- python3
- golang
- java
- c++

**will support other language soon**

## Main Features

- write testcase in the file and run test in local, support link list and tree

- debug the testcase

- memo

- support import module, bundle code and copy the build code.(only support js/ts)

- contain contest (Do not submit directly when you attending weekly contest,
  copy the code and submit in browser instead.)

## Other Features

- search question
- contain daily challenge
- support login in https://leetcode.com/ and https://leetcode-cn.com/

## Requirements

- javascript/typescript

  - Nodejs 12+

    > The `test` and `debug` will use `node` to execute.
    > Make sure that `node` is in your PATH environment variable.If you're using nvm, you may need to set the `algorithm.nodePath` in the VS Code settings.

- python3

  - Make sure that `python3` is in your PATH environment variable.
  - install the official Python extension(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

- golang

  - Make sure that `go` is in your PATH environment variable.
  - install the official golang extension

- java

  - Make sure that `java`,`javac` is in your PATH environment variable.Or [set javaPath and javacPath](#setting)
  - install the official java extension(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial)

- c++

  - Install GCC C++ compiler (g++).And make sure that `g++` is in your PATH environment variable.
  - Install the C++ extension for VS Code.
    more detail in the website (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux)

## Pick a question

Click the question in the `algorithm view`

## Switch code lang

press `ctrl+shift+p` and run the Command `algorithm:switch default language`

## shortcut buttons

> Just click the shortcut button in the `view toolbar` to

- fresh question
- search question
- login in
- switch endpoint
- collapse all

![shortcut buttons](./images/shortcut.png)

## Switch endpoint

### current support:

- leetcode.com
- leetcode-cn.com

> Note: The accounts of different endpoints are not shared.

## Login in

The way to login in referred to the official extension [vscode-leetcode](https://github.com/LeetCode-OpenSource/vscode-leetcode).

- leetcode.com support github and cookie login.
- leetcode-cn.com support account,github and cookie login.

## Test in the file

The code contains default testcase from question preview.

By clicking the test codelens hover in the vscode to run the test in local.

You can add customized testcase in the code like `// @test(param)=result`.
![test](./images/test.png)

## Debug

You only need to set breakpoints on the testcase line and set breakpoints for the code.

:tada: Then enjoy debugging!

![debug](./images/debug.png)

> Note:If you are debugging java, ensure that all problems are free of grammatical errors,because the Java extension only support one project in the directory. For example,if you open question one and skip it,then debug question two, you should return a value in question one. If you still build error when debugging,press `ctrl+shift+p` and run the Command `Java:Clean Java Language Server Workspace`.

## Submit

Click the submit hover to submit your code.

## Memo

You can create different folders and add questions to them.

## Weekly Contest

When you participate in Weekly Contest, you may choose c++,java,python. Because they have the built-in library like STL that contains priority queue,order set etc.

Now you have another choice.

### **Attention!**

Do not submit directly when you attend weekly contest,click `build` and then
click `copy` to copy code , finally paste the code in browser and submit.

### build code & copy code

This is useful in the weekly contest.

- click the build codelens hover.

![build.png](./images/build.png)

- focus the code view then click the copy icon.

![copy.png](./images/copy.png)

> The code import module [algm](https://github.com/supperchong/algm) which contains many useful function and data structure, such as `priority queue`,`Segment tree`, `union–find` ,`skip list`. :rocket: Thanks to treeshake and rollup, the bundle code is very clean.

## Setting

press `ctrl+,` or open `file->Preferences->Settings`, you will see User and Workspace setting. Workspace setting will override User setting.
open `Extensions->algorithm`,you will see the settings:

## Thanks

Thanks to the official extension [vscode-leetcode](https://github.com/LeetCode-OpenSource/vscode-leetcode), the algorithm extension
has reference some design and the login method.
