An excellent vscode extension for leetcode.

## Quick Start

![Quick Start](./images/debug.gif)

## Main Features

**currently only support javascript,typescript,python3 ,will support other language soon**

- write testcase in the file and run test in local, support link list and tree

- debug the testcase

- support import module, bundle code and copy the build code

- contain contest (Do not submit directly when you attending weekly contest,
  copy the code and submit in browser instead.)

## Other Features

- search question
- contain daily challenge
- support login in https://leetcode.com/ and https://leetcode-cn.com/

## Requirements

- javascript/typescript

  - Nodejs 12+

    > The `test` and `debug` will use `node` to execute.
    > Make sure that `node` is in your PATH environment variable.If you're using nvm, you may need to set the `algorithm.nodePath` in the VS Code settings.

- python3

  - python3

## Pick a question

Click the question in the `algorithm view`

## Switch code lang

press `ctrl+shift+p` and run the Command `algorithm:switch default language`

## shortcut buttons

> Just click the shortcut button in the `view toolbar` to

- fresh question
- search question
- login in
- switch endpoint
- collapse all

## Switch endpoint

### current support:

- leetcode.com
- leetcode-cn.com

> Note: The accounts of different endpoints are not shared.

## Login in

The way to login in referred to the official extension [vscode-leetcode](https://github.com/LeetCode-OpenSource/vscode-leetcode).

- leetcode.com support github and cookie login.
- leetcode-cn.com support account,github and cookie login.

## Test in the file

The code contains default testcase from question preview.

By clicking the test codelens hover in the vscode to run the test in local.

You can add customized testcase in the code like `// @test(param)=result`.

## Debug

You only need to set breakpoints on the testcase line and set breakpoints for the code.

:tada: Then enjoy debugging!

## Submit

Click the submit hover to submit your code.

## Weekly Contest

When you participate in Weekly Contest, you may choose c++,java,python. Because they have the built-in library like STL that contains priority queue,order set etc.

Now you have another choice.

### **Attention!**

Do not submit directly when you attend weekly contest,click `build` and then
click `copy` to copy code , finally paste the code in browser and submit.

### build code & copy code

This is useful in the weekly contest.

- click the build codelens hover.

- focus the code view then click the copy icon.

> The code import module [algm](https://github.com/supperchong/algm) which contains many useful function and data structure, such as `priority queue`,`Segment tree`, `unionâ€“find` ,`skip list`. :rocket: Thanks to treeshake and rollup, the bundle code is very clean.

## Setting
